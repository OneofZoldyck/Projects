|
Sign Language Recognition System | The Sign Language Recognition System is a computer vision project that aims to recognize and interpret sign language gestures captured by a camera. The system is built using Python programming language and OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library. This system can be used to facilitate communication between the deaf and hearing communities, and help break the communication barrier. With the help of machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques, the system can accurately recognize and translate sign language gestures into text or speech in real-time. |
| Composing Song Lyrics using Natural Language Processing (Recurrent Neural Network) | The project aims to generate song lyrics using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing techniques. The project was developed in Python and utilized a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to analyze and generate lyrics. The project was trained on a large dataset of song lyrics and used this information to generate new, unique lyrics that could be used in song composition. The final output of the project was a system that could generate song lyrics in a specified style and genre based on input parameters. |

Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network | The project was aimed to develop a system that could accurately classify images based on their visual content. The project was implemented in Python and utilized OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library. The system used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a type of deep learning network that is specifically designed for image recognition tasks, to classify the images. The CNN was trained on a large dataset of labeled images, allowing it to learn the patterns and features that distinguish different image categories. The final output of the project was a system that could accurately classify a given image into one of several pre-defined categories, such as "dog", "cat", "car", etc. |
| Virtual Car Dealership | The project was aimed to create an online marketplace that would allow individuals and car dealerships to buy and sell vehicles. The platform was developed using PHP as the server-side scripting language, HTML for the structure, Bootstrap for styling, and MongoDB as the database management system. The platform provided a user-friendly interface for users to list their vehicles for sale. The online marketplace was designed to make the process of buying and selling cars more convenient and accessible, by bringing buyers and sellers together in one platform. The final output of the project was an online marketplace that would make it easier for individuals and car dealerships to buy and sell vehicles. |
